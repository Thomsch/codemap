# FP-Codemap

As part of an on-going [research project](https://www.notion.so/Codemap-ec02c79cb0b44304ba10767af1ca3788), we explore local interactive software visualizations aimed to help developers explore and locate information about methods and classes necessary to fix bugs and develop new features. We present our findings and results with a [report and two visualization concepts](https://cse512-21s.github.io/FP-Codemap/).
