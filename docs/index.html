      <h2>Final Project</h2>
      <p>
        As part of an on-going <a href="https://www.notion.so/Codemap-ec02c79cb0b44304ba10767af1ca3788">research
          project</a>, we explore local interactive software visualizations aimed to help developers explore and locate
        information about methods and classes necessary to fix bugs and develop new features. We present our findings
        and results with a short project report and two visualizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, we conducted a user study to evaluate if an integrated interactive visualization to an IDE was useful to developers to navigate source code, and find related classes and methods. For this we developed a <a href="https://github.com/amyjzhu/503-hacking/">rough prototype</a> to support the experiment. The visualization used a zooming technique, similar in essence to Google Maps, to move between different levels of abstraction.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We found that the visualization was generally helpful to the participants. Specifically, the following features were promising: 

        <ul>
          <li>The visualization is initially centered on the class the user is editing</li>
          <li>Moving seamlessly between levels of abstraction visually (similarly to Google Maps)</li>
          <li>Switching between the source code of a class and its visualization with a click</li>
          <li>Exploring dependencies interactively (by clicking on the edge connecting the methods or classes)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We also found that the representation of each level of abstraction was lacking. Participants complained that packages, classes, and method were too far apart or too close together, creating occlusion problems in the latter case. These issues stem from the force layout we used. We also ran into performance and complexity issues with larger code bases that we mitigated with interactive filters and just-in-time rendering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, with this final project, we aim to explore individual visualization to represent different levels of abstraction in source code capable of addressing these issues. The visualizations will be focused on working from a local perspective (i.e., showing dependencies from a given method rather than showing the entire dependency graph) and interactivity based on existing visualization techniques (e.g., Voronoi, Hyperbolic Layout, Hierarchical Edge Bundling, Radial Tree).
      </p>

      <p>
        This project will not implement the mechanisms to blend the visualization of the levels of abstraction, this will be for another time. Additionally, this project will not focus on the integration between the visualization and the IDE because the basic mechanisms were implemented in the previous prototype. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Below, we present an global overview of Codemap using Munzner's nested model [<a href="#ref-munzner">4</a>]. The closest working implementation is currently the Codemap prototype used to do the initial user study [<a href="#ref-codemap">9</a>]. The goal of the model is to put the accent on the zooming mechanism and general philosophy tying in the visualization experience to the integrated environment in a developer-centered experience.

          <p>
            Conducted a user study on a rough visualization prototype integrated to Visual Studio Code as a plugin to gather initial feedback. Participants noted that integration was really important and made heavy use of click through to go from one method to another. Also found the zooming feature useful to answer questions.

        In this prototype, we explore how dependencies between methods can be visualized from an initial method using radial tree and hierarchical edge bundling.

        In this prototype, we explore how the class and package hierarchy can be visualized from an initial perspective using Voronoi diagrams. For example using <a href="https://github.com/Kcnarf/d3-voronoi-treemap">d3-voronoi-treemap</a>.

                    The diagram is seeded so the map doesn't change every time its regenerated even though the content of the data doesn't change. The seed is assigned to the data so every time the data changes, a new map is generated, marking a new version of the data. In a live development setting, we would need a less naive approach. For example, growing the map as changes are made, minimizing displacement of the cells similarly how Gource [<a href="#ref-gource">10</a>], a popular version control visualization, does it.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        With this final course project, I was able to advance my research and apply concepts learned in class.
        Specifically, I refined the scope of the research project, explored related work on software visualization, and
        compared ways to visualize network graph adapted to displaying relation between software artifacts, designed and
        prototyped two visualization to respectively represent the class hierarchy and represent dependencies between
        methods.

        The next steps are two-fold. First, finish implementing the visualization prototypes with all the features
        mentioned in their model design and evaluate them in a small user study. Second, merge the concepts from the
        visualizations into one unified visualization where the level of abstraction is controlled by zooming, building
        on the technique the initial prototype we already evaluated.

        In summary, on top of putting in practice what I learned in the course and solidifying my budding D3 skills,
        this final project enabled me to make significant headway into this research project in terms of background,
        direction, motivation, and working prototypes.
