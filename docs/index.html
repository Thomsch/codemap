      <h2>Final Project</h2>
      <p>
        As part of an on-going <a href="https://www.notion.so/Codemap-ec02c79cb0b44304ba10767af1ca3788">research project</a>, we explore local interactive software visualizations that helps the developer understand a software artifact's (e.g., class, method) neighborhood necessary to fix bugs and develop new features.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, we conducted a user study to evaluate if an integrated interactive visualization to an IDE was useful to developers to navigate source code, and find related classes and methods. For this we developed a <a href="https://github.com/amyjzhu/503-hacking/">rough prototype</a> to support the experiment. The visualization used a zooming technique, similar in essence to Google Maps, to move between different levels of abstraction.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We found that the visualization was generally helpful to the participants. Specifically, the following features were promising: 

        <ul>
          <li>The visualization is initially centered on the class the user is editing</li>
          <li>Moving seamlessly between levels of abstraction visually (similarly to Google Maps)</li>
          <li>Switching between the source code of a class and its visualization with a click</li>
          <li>Exploring dependencies interactively (by clicking on the edge connecting the methods or classes)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We also found that the representation of each level of abstraction was lacking. Participants complained that packages, classes, and method were too far apart or too close together, creating occlusion problems in the latter case. These issues stem from the force layout we used. We also ran into performance and complexity issues with larger code bases that we mitigated with interactive filters and just-in-time rendering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, with this final project, we aim to explore individual visualization to represent different levels of abstraction in source code capable of addressing these issues. The visualizations will be focused on working from a local perspective (i.e., showing dependencies from a given method rather than showing the entire dependency graph) and interactivity based on existing visualization techniques (e.g., Voronoi, Hyperbolic Layout, Hierarchical Edge Bundling, Radial Tree).
      </p>

      <p>
        This project will not implement the mechanisms to blend the visualization of the levels of abstraction, this will be for another time. Additionally, this project will not focus on the integration between the visualization and the IDE because the basic mechanisms were implemented in the previous prototype.

          <p>
            We are interested to help the developer build a mental image of the source code. Mental image of the source code is necessary before fixing a bug or implementing a new feature to locate artifacts or interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conducted a user study on a rough visualization prototype integrated to Visual Studio Code as a plugin to gather initial feedback. Participants noted that integration was really important and made heavy use of click through to go from one method to another. Also found the zooming feature useful to answer questions.

      <h2>Visualization</h2>
      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <p>
        In this prototype, we explore how dependencies between methods can be visualized from an initial method using radial tree and hierarchical edge bundling.
      </p>
      
      <div id='method-level' class="visualization"></div>

      <h3>Classes</h3>      
      <p>
        In this prototype, we explore how the class and package hierarchy can be visualized from an initial perspective using Voronoi diagrams. For example using <a href="https://github.com/Kcnarf/d3-voronoi-treemap">d3-voronoi-treemap</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Milestone</h2>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      The text descriptions were very helpful to understand your project, and I particularly like how you integrated Munzner's nested model for design! 

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Using a hyperbolic layout seems adapted to visualize method dependencies to manage the high number of methods without compromising and discoverability. However, it seems complicated to implement from scratch. I found <a href="https://github.com/glouwa/d3-hypertree">this implementation</a>, but I'm not sure it's worth it performance wise. Any thoughts?
          </p>

          <p><em>Having implemented hyperbolic layout myself, it is certainly do-able but may take up too much time for your overall project. <strong>A radial tree view might be a reasonable alternative that is quicker to develop.</strong></em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I'm using this final project to explore visualizations for different levels of abstraction for my research. Ultimately, the developer would be able to move between levels using a zooming mechanism, similarly to how Google Maps works. Thus, I initially wanted to explore visualizations for various levels, but I'm not sure I'll have enough time to look at multiple visualizations to satisfy the course requirements although it would be useful for my research. What would be the recommended course of action in this case? Which objectives should I aim for?</p>

          <p><em><strong>I would encourage you to follow the path that most helps your research.</strong> For the course, if you are focused on implementation, getting a polished and performant design can be time-consuming, so it is probably better to focus on that than to split your effort over multiple, more-hastily-constructed designs. On the other hand, if you are focused on design, you could explore multiple concepts and make a design brief as your final deliverable (potentially with interactive prototypes, while being clear they are not "polished" components).</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>During the course project, I also spent considerable time scoping the research project, and looking at references. This work helps this course project and the larger research project. Can I showcase this "background" work for the course project? What would be the best way to do it?</p>

          <p><em><strong>You're certainly free to include this (for example as part of your README.md) and I will certainly "give you credit" for that work.</strong> As for the video demonstration, you could think about what is a compelling way to share insights from this background work should you want to include them.</em></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Initial Prompt</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the final project is to provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, and/or evaluating a
        visualization method, algorithm, or tool. Your project should address a concrete visualization problem and
        propose a novel, creative solution. The final deliverables will be the results of your project (typically a
        visualization prototype or research report) and a 2 minute video communicating your project goals and results.
